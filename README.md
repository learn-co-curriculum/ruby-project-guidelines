# As a user of our application, an artist can do a few things:
    1. Create a profile/account if they do not have one.
    2. Create a date for a venue location to perform.
    3. View all of their current dates and matching venues.
    4. Update any existing venue dates. 
    5. Delete any existing concert or venue dates.
